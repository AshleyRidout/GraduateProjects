# Connect To Database And Query
Projects in this folder connect to a derby SQL database and perform a query. EmployeeSQL selects employee names whether
they have a middle name or not and splits the full name to only return the employee's first and last names. EmployeePromotedSQL
creates a promoted table and inserts employees with at or above a certain salary (in this case 100,000) and at or above a certain 
numbers of service years (in this case 5). It then prints the updated salary with the employee's id and full name.
