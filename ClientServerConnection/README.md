# Client Server Connection
All GradAccept classes use a client-server connection to allow users to input their GPA, GRE, and two letter of recommendation scores.
The program uses this information to determine if the student is accepted into the graduate program. There is a server that can accept 
one client (GradAcceptOneServer), as well as a server that can accept multiple clients (GradAcceptMultiThreadServer). GradAcceptOneObject
containes the logic for graduate program acceptance.
