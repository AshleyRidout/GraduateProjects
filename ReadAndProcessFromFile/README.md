#ReadAndProcessFromFile
Projects in this folder focus on reading from a .txt file, doing some work on the text, 
and then saving the updated data if there were changes.
ChangeLastNames reads last names from a .txt file, changes all 'e' and 'a' to 'E' and 'A',
print this change to the console, and then save the file with these changes.
