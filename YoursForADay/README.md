Yours For A Day (YFAD) is an Android based application to connect Seekers (users who wish to rent an item) 
to Keepers (users who wish to rent out an item). There is a registration page to sign up and users are 
required to input a user name and password to enter YFAD. The information on the registration page is
sent to an outside database for security purposes. Keepers can input multiple items with a name, price,
and quantity that is stored in a SQLite database. Seekers can access this information by inputting a name
and maximum price they will pay to rent an item. YFAD will only return items that match this name and are 
equal to or less than the Seeker maximum price.
